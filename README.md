# FMI-Weekly-Schedule-Helper
Project repo for the "Introduction to programming in Python" course of the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics, Sofia University. 
The idea of the project is to help students with selecting a weekly schedule by parsing the giant pool of available subjects into a formatable one, which could be appliable to each student and his personal interests/needs. The current version of the project is focused on making a desktop application and I plan to transform it in the future into a server-user, where ratings and comments will be stored in a database and not only in the user's personal computer.
